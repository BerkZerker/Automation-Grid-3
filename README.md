# Automation-Grid-3

The goal of this project is to build a 3d procedurally based blocky terrain (non editalbe) like in minecraft in the Godot 4 engine. The terrain has different types of biomes and resources that can be farmed by the player. The terrain is generated using a combination of Perlin noise and other algorithms to create a realistic and diverse landscape.

The player must build automations and factories to harvest resources from the terrain and process them into useful items.

## Core mechanics

- Procedural terrain generation with different biomes
- Resource gathering and processing
- Automation and factory building
- Tower defense against waves of enemies
- Enemy AI and pathfinding
- Day and night cycle
- Weather / event system
- Research and technology tree
- Multiplayer support
